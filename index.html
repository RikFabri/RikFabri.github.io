						I'm a software developer from Belgium. I enjoy most computer-related disciplines and try to be a jack of all trades. However, my focus is game development, which I'm currently studying at <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/">DAE</a></u>.
						<br><br>
						I love creating things, especially when I can witness others enjoying my work. It's what drives me to make anything from cmake systems to games, or even other things like music.

					<p>
						I wrote this <u>C++</u> CHIP-8 VM/interpreter because I wanted to experiment with <u>cmake</u>, <u>QT</u> and learn about emulator development. This project combines it all! 
						<br>The project is fully functional, except for sound. However, I'm doing my graduation work on gameboy sound and will probably add sound support here afterwards.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Emulation</h3>
					<p>Opcodes are the heart of any emulator (or cpu). For Chip-8 each opcode is 2 bytes (big-endian) consisting of bits to identify the opcode and bits that contain data.
						For example, "00EE" returns from a subroutine and "2NNN" calls a subroutine at whatever value "NNN" has. The following code is used to identify an opcode and know which function it relates to.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/6899d2ab4c45a2548e3b1fd191e25825.js"></script>
					<p>We can then simply loop over a vector containing our OpcodeDetails and call the appropriate functions like this.</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d598ca82845093856076134291835bca.js"></script>
					<h3>Sprites</h3>
					<p>Chip-8 has an interesting way of handling sprites and collisions. Drawing a sprite uses opcode "DXYN" which provides us with both the registers for the x and y coordinates and the height of the sprite (n).
						To actually draw the sprite, we read a byte for each row in the sprite (n) at the memory address stored in I (this is a special 16bit register meant to store memory addresses).
						Each bit represents whether or not a pixel is white. The pixel is then xor'ed onto the display, if an older pixel is unset, a collision flag is set for later use.
						This way, we can draw sprites that are 8 pixels wide (1 byte) and n-rows long.
						<br><br>
						In the code snippet underneath, vm.Vx is the virtual machine's array of registers.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/79a53d70f335ec25d0270812d0308af5.js"></script>
					<h3>QT</h3>
					<p>
						The hardest part of setting up QT for this project was figuring out how to render the emulator's viewport.
						I tried opengl but eventually decided that was overkill and settled for the built-in QPainter class. 
						In the end, I made a widget that inherits from QOpenGLWidget and overrides the paintEvent method like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/8e797231cbfd3731663d2733a485a22f.js"></script>
					<h3>Cmake</h3>
					<p>
						The cmake for this project ended up being really simple. The CMakeLists for QT is almost entirely managed by QT creator.
						The Chip-8 part is compiled as a stand-alone library like this.
					</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/d2ee11056d7943566f73de4dc21178d2.js"></script>
					<br>
					<p>
						We then tie together the project like this:

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
						Easy textures is a small (2 files) plugin that allows users to drag and drop an image into Maya to use it as a texture. Much like the behaviour in 3dsMax.
						Next to automatically creating and applying the shaders, the plugin also keeps track of the existing ones to prevent duplicates. 
					</p><br>
					<h3>Automating shaders</h3>
					<p>The heart of the program is creating a shader, which I do like this:</p><br>
					<script src="https://gist.github.com/RikFabri/baf08c6bf8d636b924e597af0ecafeb2.js"></script><br>
					<h3>Drag and drop</h3>
					<p>
						We change the default drag and drop behaviour by overriding the "performFileDropAction" function.
						I altered <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gist.github.com/Meatplowz/376d7483d557c47f2ef8bdf3023fdf16">Meatplowz' gist</a> 
						for this and kept his implementation for the "open", "import" and "reference" buttons.
						The following <u>condensed</u> code snippet shows the "apply texture" button that I added, and how I managed to execute my python script from MEL.

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Nox is a 2,5D atmospheric puzzle platform game set in an 80's arcade. Made for the DAE course "game projects". Most of the codebase is written in <u>Unreal C++</u>, although we also used <u>blueprints</u> when that made more sense.
						The entire project was under <u>perforce</u> version control.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Team</h3>
					<p> 
						We were a team of 2 programmers and 4 artists (Both me and the other programmer had no prior unreal C++ experience).
						 Everyone put in around 80-100 hours.
						I myself did most of the gameplay programming, including:
					</p><br>
					<ul>
						<li>Pushing/Pulling</li>
						<li>Spiderwebs that lock objects</li>
						<li>Climbing</li>
						<li>Ziplining</li>
						<li>Rope splinemeshes</li>
						<li>Collectables base</li>
						<li>General purpose levers, easily extensible in blueprints for our level designers</li>
						<li>Bossfight (generating leg movement through IK, spider-pushable and spider-player interactions)</li>
						<li>...</li>

					<h3>Game Jam</h3>
					<p>
						I made this game with a good friend for the <u>Ludum Dare 42 game jam</u>. This was before I started studying at DAE and even though I knew a decent amount about C++, the good practices were definitely not there.
					</p><br>
					<h3>Mistakes</h3>
					<p>
						There's so much wrong with the codebase that I can't possibly give you focused code snippets.
						Restarting the game was an afterthought I fixed with a goto, causing the biggest memory leak imaginable.
						I knew about constructors, but not about the initializer list and didn't use the destructor. So goodbye RAII principles and hello even more memory leaks!
						The Spaceship's render method wasn't const and has a shocking amount of gameplay logic in there.
						<br>The list goes on, really.<br>
						(You can find the code via our LDJam page, but I won't link to it directly to prevent people from opening it without reading this.)
					</p><br>
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>I guess the reason this project is still on my portfolio is simply that it was my first "real" game, we did a pretty good game jam even though our skillset was lacking to say the least.
						<br>It's also an indicator on how far I've come since then and a reminder of why I got into videogames.
